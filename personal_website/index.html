            <h2> School Life</h2>
            <p> My name is Bradley Gee and I was born and raised in <strong>Port Coquitlam, British Columbia</strong>. I <em> love</em> to play the game of Basketball. I played throughout high school, and then decided to try running as a sport in post secondary. I have done many half marathon, and hoping after the pandemic I can do a Full marathon.  In my first year I went to University of British Columbia Okanagan, where I had studied Computer Science.After first year I decided to return home and study at BCIT. Currently I am in the Computer Information Technology program and these are <a href = "../misc/courses.html"> my courses </a></p>
